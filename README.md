## Set Up
*Twitter API: to run the twitter API, users need to import their own API keys.
*cv2: users need to install the opencv enviornment before they use cv2. Command is : pip install pip install openCV-python.
*Users need to include the STIXGeneral.ttf in the file to run the program.

## Step of the homework
### Develop a queue system that can exercise your requirements with stub functions.
### Develop the twitter functionality with an API
### Integrate them

## To Run this Program
After setting up all prerequiste enviornment, just run the sys.py. Then you will get the User + _ + photo file which store the photos which have the twitters' comments on it and a video of that specific user.

## Result
### The photos of the user's twitter comments.
